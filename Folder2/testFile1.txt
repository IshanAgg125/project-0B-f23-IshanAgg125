My primary goal as a CST ambassador is to communicate with prospective students. Furthermore, I am responsible for ensuring that if a student were to enroll at temple his or her on boarding process is done efficiently.

As a software testing intern my goal was to analyze code, test code and optimize code. I was also responsible for implementing best coding practices into the project, as well as adapting the code in line with technical requirements.  

I am involved in the creation and research of technology which will help improve the quality of education. My current research includes creating chatbots for novice programmers to help them with writing code. We made this possible by providing reminders, constructive feedback, and a checklist for their assignments.

Behavioral interview apply the STAR. I me, me, me and I lead. It is all about you. This for you individually. 

Situation: Share the nature of the event, project or challenge. Exaggerate everything to make yourself sound the best. 

Task: Describe your specific responsibility in the process. 

Action: Steps undertaken to move towards an outcome

Result: End results of your individual involvement.

Key to stand out is make it sound robotic. But more actual and very conversational. Back and forth conversation. Flowing off of the tongue.
